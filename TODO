MODULE STRUCTURE

-> Exchange data module
--> Classes represent exchanges
--> Instantiate a class with a callback, delay
--> Every frame it calls callback with orderbook data structure below

-> Exchange trading/transfer module
--> Classes represent exchanges
--> Function to trade one currency for another, blocks until complete or returns exception
--> Function to transfer a currency to an address, blocks until complete or returns exception
--> Locks on the exchange (??!?!?!!)

-> Brain module
--> Initialization
--> Cycle class
--> Starts all the exchange data modules with the same callback to update the data structure
--> Exchange data modules grab data in parallel, lock on data, brain attempts to do computations on data
--> Every time cycles are found brain creates new instance of cycle module and adds it to monitor list
--> Cycles consist of orders to be fulfilled
--> Currently running cycles' orders are removed from graph before attempting to find new cycles
--> Above is accomplished either in brain code or callback given to exchanges
--> Brain keeps track of profit so far and prints this out and other stats


DATA STRUCTURE

orderbook[CUR_1][CUR_2] = [{'variable_cost':1.02,'volume':40,'fixed_cost':0.0},{'variable_cost':1.03,'volume':30,'fixed_cost':0.01},...]
variable_cost is how much you can immediately buy 1 unit of CUR_1 for in terms of CUR_2
variable_cost is how much someone else is selling 1 unit of CUR_1 for in terms of CUR_2
1.0/variable_cost is how much you can immediately sell 1 unit of CUR_2 in terms of CUR_1
1.0/variable_cost is how much someone else is buying 1 unit of CUR_2 in terms of CUR_1
fixed_cost is how much it costs in CUR_1 to purchase any number of units of CUR_1

orderbook[CUR_2][CUR_1] = [{'variable_cost':1.00,'volume':30,'fixed_cost':0.01},{'variable_cost':0.99,'volume':10,'fixed_cost':0.01},...]
variable_cost is how much you can immediately buy 1 unit of CUR_2 for in terms of CUR_1
variable_cost is how much someone else is selling 1 unit of CUR_2 for in terms of CUR_1
1.0/variable_cost is how much you can immediately sell 1 unit of CUR_1 for in terms of CUR_2
1.0/variable_cost is how much someone else is buying 1 unit of CUR_1 in terms of CUR_2
fixed_cost is how much it costs in CUR_2 to purchase any number of units of CUR_2

currency is formatted like
BTC_BTCE
LTC_POLONIEX
